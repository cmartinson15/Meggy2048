	As you enter the ice rink you look at the tiny paper that was given to you by your master. The name of 13 targets are on the paper and its your job to kill them all. You are under the training of the greatest assassin in the modern era and you must make him proud. You can see one of your targets now in a bright blue suit but he has a bodyguard. It\'92d be nice if you didn\'92t end up fighting with the big man in red so try your hardest to just kill your targets, you know these bodyguards they end up multiplying like the heads of a hydra. It\'92s time now, and you start skating across the floor, there is no stopping until all the targets are dead.\
	The writing of my Meggy game was long and tedious. It went from being a Meggy version of 2048 to being what it is now, a short game where the player controls a skating assassin. I honestly like this new game a lot more than I did the 2048 game because it feels more free and relaxed, 2048 takes a lot of thinking for the player so using it as a relaxing past time isn\'92t really an option. What was really difficult for me during this entire final project stage was all of the coding I needed for the 2048 game, which was honestly way too hard for me. Everything made little sense and I didn\'92t understand half of the things that you were helping me with. The hardest part about my final game was the fact that I only had from Monday to do it. However surprisingly all the coding that I did in this week was really fun. I enjoyed it compared to the 2048 game where I just felt like I was a slave building the great pyramids of Egypt. Without the help that I received from everyone in the class I would not have been able to produce a solid and sound game at the end of it all. Though I could have made a playable game for the end project, without Jacob and Kaitlyn\'92s help especially I would have been stuck in a bad position from a while ago. The only bug that I still have right now is the block getting stuck in the top right corner. I don\'92t know why it does this since everywhere else on the board runs smoothly but it is a minor bug. After getting stuck in the corner the player can press any directional button to make the player move again but it still irritates me. If I had more time on this project I would have liked to have added more enemies and challenges for the player or added power-ups for the player that would make them invincible to one or two enemy hits. Something that would make this game better would be moving enemies because right now, they too are stationary. If they randomly moved as the player moved (maybe if I made it a turn based instead of it constantly going), I feel like the game would be way more challenging and entertaining. From this game I learned that it is extremely important to comment your code so that if other people ever look at it they can understand what\'92s going on. More importantly, if you forget what the code does and you comment it, you can easily figure out what you were looking for. I learned from this that a game is actually very free form during its creation stage. Somethings get added in and somethings get taken out but its all for a purpose or reason. The original concept of the game and the finished product could be two very different things, just as my game was. In the beginning it was supposed to be 2048. On Monday when you had me switch it became a turn based game where the player was a tank that went around destroying buildings. Now it\'92s a game about an assassin in an ice rink. The evolution of a game from beginning to end is one of the most interesting things that I have experienced in this class. From this project I have learned that no matter what happens in life you have to persevere and keep working through it. If there is an obstacle you always have friends to help you out but in the end, you will succeed in your journey.}
